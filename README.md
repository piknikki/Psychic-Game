Letter guessing game, javascript project

In this game, you will try to guess what letter the computer has randomly chosen for you.  So you have a 1/26th chance of guessing correctly on the first try!  

You have 10 guesses, which will be shown to you.  You'll also be able to see what letters you've chosen (so you don't try them again).  Your wins and losses will be tracked so you know where you stand.  A win is when you choose the same letter as the random letter.  A loss is when you don't get it after 10 tries.

Good luck!!
